# This is *supposed* to prevent linking libgpm.so with -lncurses,
# but for some reason it doesn't have the desired effect here.
# Any ideas?  The patch is supposed to resolve a circular dependency
# between libgpm.so and libncurses.so.  I don't notice any ill effects
# here, but perhaps the problem would occur if prelinking was used.
# Also, ncurses has not shown an ldd link to libgpm for several releases,
# so perhaps any problem that existed was fixed on their end.
# NOTE:  Since this isn't preventing gpm from linking to ncurses, I'm
# commenting this patch out until we understand better if it's even
# useful for anything.  Half a patch seems worse than no patch.
